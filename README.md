# This is the ThermalShift documents currently in use for simulations and analysis.

You will find here the main code for experiments written in Python that requires a stack (T-stack or P-stack) with metadata file joined.
The simulations uses Julia and requires the folder "simulations_codes" in which all parameters are defined as well as propagation functions.
You'll find also a csv file named "wvlengths.csv" that contains the value of absorption in function of wavelength, linearly interpolated from Hale and Querry's paper.
